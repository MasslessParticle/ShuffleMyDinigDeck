            Among other things, I love great food and Denver has no shortage of it. Having recently relocated here,
            I was truly excited to try the local fare.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had a couple of problems, though. First: I didn't know anywhere to eat. Second: As I started finding
            places, I couldn't decide where to go next.

        </p>

            Enter the Dining Deck. It's a product sold by <a href="http://eatdenver.com/">EatDenver</a>, an association of locally-owned Independent
            restaurants, that has 52 $10 coupons for some of the tastiest restaurants in the Denver Metro Area. After
            picking up a Dining Deck for myself, I had another problem: Analysis Paralysis. With 52 choices staring at
            me every time I got hungry, I just couldn't decide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being a programmer, I decided that I'd solve this issue with code. Not only could I create something to
            help me know where to eat but I'd also get to play with some new technology.

            This site is the result. It will choose three restaurants randomly from the Dining Deck and present you with
            their description, address, relative price, and phone number. You can even filter the results by the maximum
            cost and neighborhood. If you register, you can keep track of where you've eaten so you don't ever get stale
            recommendations.
